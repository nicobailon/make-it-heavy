# Make It Heavy - Changes Summary

## Overview
This pull request adds comprehensive testing infrastructure and Claude Code CLI integration to the Make It Heavy framework, a Python-based multi-agent system that emulates Grok Heavy functionality.

## Major Changes

### 1. Testing Infrastructure
- **Added complete pytest-based test suite** replacing the previous superficial test runner
- **Test organization**:
  - Unit tests for agent factory, run loop, and core components
  - Integration tests for tool system and API failure handling
  - End-to-end tests for user calculation scenarios
  - Stress tests for concurrent agent execution
- **Test tooling**:
  - `pytest.ini` configuration with parallel execution support
  - `run_tests.py` wrapper script for convenient test execution
  - Mock implementations for OpenAI client to enable isolated testing
  - Comprehensive fixtures and test data

### 2. GitHub Actions CI/CD
- **Added `.github/workflows/test.yml`** for continuous integration
- Runs on pushes and pull requests to main branch
- Uses Python 3.12 with `uv` package manager
- Executes full test suite with coverage reporting
- Integrates with Codecov for coverage tracking

### 3. Claude Code CLI Provider Enhancement
- **Modified `config.yaml`** to use Claude Code as the default provider
- **Enhanced `agent.py`**:
  - Added dependency injection support for OpenAI client
  - Created `create_agent()` factory function for provider selection
  - Improved modularity for testing

### 4. Documentation Updates
- **Extended `CLAUDE.md`** with comprehensive test generation guidelines:
  - Behavior-focused testing principles
  - Test quality checklist and anti-patterns
  - Test failure response protocols
  - Test stability requirements
- **Updated `README.md`** with testing section:
  - Instructions for running tests locally
  - Coverage reporting information
  - Stress testing documentation

### 5. Tool System Improvements
- **Enhanced `tools/__init__.py`**:
  - Added `__all__` export for better IDE support
  - Implemented `__getattr__` for dynamic tool access
  - Improved error handling and module discovery

### 6. Dependencies
- **Updated `requirements.txt`** with testing dependencies:
  - pytest and pytest-cov for test execution and coverage
  - pytest-xdist for parallel test execution
  - pytest-asyncio for async test support
  - freezegun for time-based test control

## Testing Philosophy
The changes implement a behavior-focused testing approach that:
- Verifies requirements rather than implementation details
- Tests observable outcomes from a user perspective
- Maintains test stability through isolation and determinism
- Follows TDD principles (Red → Green → Refactor)

## Impact
These changes significantly improve the project's maintainability and reliability by:
- Enabling automated testing in CI/CD pipelines
- Providing comprehensive test coverage for all major components
- Supporting both OpenRouter and Claude Code providers seamlessly
- Establishing clear testing guidelines for future development
